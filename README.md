# Customer Segmentation Project

## Summary
This project aimed to identify distinct customer segments from a dataset of mall customers to tailor marketing strategies effectively. The dataset contained various attributes, including customer demographics, annual income, and spending scores. By applying K-means clustering, we grouped customers based on their behaviors and characteristics.

## Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Clustering Techniques (K-means)

## Code Overview
The code included data loading and cleaning processes using Pandas, where we handled missing values and encoded categorical data. K-means clustering was applied to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending scores. After clustering, we exported the results to a CSV file for visualization in Power BI. Key calculations included the creation of average metrics and totals for various features, which were later visualized in Power BI.

## Visualisation in Power BI
- Imported the dataset with customer information.
- Created several visualizations, including:
  - Bar Chart: Average Spending Score by Cluster
  - Scatter Plot: Age vs. Annual Income Colored by Cluster
  - Pie Chart: Gender Distribution by Cluster
  - Line Chart: Average Annual Income Trend by Cluster
- Developed measures to calculate averages and totals for better insight into customer segments.
